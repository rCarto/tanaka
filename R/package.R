#' The tanaka package is a simplified implementation of the Tanaka method.
#' Also called "relief contours method", "illuminated contour method", or
#' "shaded contour lines method", the Tanaka method enhances the representation
#' of topography on a map using shaded contour lines. North-west white contours
#' represent illuminated topography and south-east black contours represent
#' shaded topography.
